# simple_typing_test
 A very simple implementation of a typing test based on a sample of 500, 6-letter words within the english dictionary. This was simply made as a way to practice my own touch typing skills. I may eventually implement this with its own GUI or deploy it as a web app, as well as increase the amount of possible words.
